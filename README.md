**System requirements:**
  - MSX 2 Computer (or some emulator: e.g. blueMSX, openMSX)
  - MSX-DOS 2

**Source dependencies:**
  - sdcc (C compiler for the Z80)
  - Makefile
  - hex2bin: https://sourceforge.net/projects/hex2bin/
  - optional: openMSX + MSXDOS2 + MSX2 Rom (for testing)

**How to compile:**
  - Just type "make" on the command line

**How to run:**
  - Once compiled, the executable file "pongblas.com" is located in the "bin" folder.
  - Either copy "pongblas.com" to a real MSX 2 computer, or copy it to a disk image for using on an emulator. You can adapt the "make-run" command in the Makefile in order to test it in a more practical way.
